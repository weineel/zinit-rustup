# weineel/zinit-rustup

**Note: zinit and zplugin are different names of the same thing**

An empty repository to aid zplugin's hooks-hacks. You can fork it to have a private copy of it :)

Example uses:

When what's needed is an atclone'' hook to e.g. install a software (plus atpull'' hook to update it):

```
# The invocation uses https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/null repo as a placeholder
# for the atclone'' and atpull'' hooks
# run-atpullï¼šEven if this repository has not been updated, atpull will still be executed during `zinit update weineel/zinit-rustup`.

export RUSTUP_DIST_SERVER="https://rsproxy.cn"
export RUSTUP_UPDATE_ROOT="https://rsproxy.cn/rustup"
zinit as"program" pick"rustup" \
  atclone"curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh && source \"$HOME/.cargo/env\"" \
  atpull"rustup update" \
  run-atpull \
  for weineel/zinit-rustup
```
